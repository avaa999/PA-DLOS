## __Learning Physics-Aware Sensorimotor Model with Visuotactile Sensing for Deformable Linear Objects Manipulation__

ðŸ’¡ We are working on an learning physics-aware sensorimotor model for shape control of Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs) with unknown physical properties. The paper has been submitted to _IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL)_, and we plan to open-source the code after the paper is accepted.

## Paper abstract
Abstractâ€”Learning accurate sensorimotor modele between robot motion and shape deformation of Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs) remains challenging, especially for those with unknown physical properties. This letter presents the Physics-Aware Deformable Linear Object Shaping (PA-DLOS) framework, which enables shape control of such DLOs. Specifically, the proposed global neural network-based DLO deformation model, trained in simulation, is conditioned on physics embeddings that are estimated in real time by a visuotactile-based multimodal model. On this basis, precise shape servoing of unseen DLOs can be achieved via a dual-stage online optimization strategy, which modulates the simulation-trained deformation model according to online visual and tactile feedback. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that PADLOS outperforms representative data-driven methods in both DLO deformation modeling and shape control.Trained solely in simulation, our framework achieves a 100% success rate and the highest accuracy in real-world shape servoing tasks.
